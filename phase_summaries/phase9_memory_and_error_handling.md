# Phase 9: Memory Management & Error Handling

## Summary
- Utility files for memory management and error handling exist (`src/utils/`).
- Some memory and error handling logic is present in shell loop and redirection code.
- Dedicated memory management and error handling modules are currently empty or minimal.

## Assessment
- Memory management and error handling are partially implemented.
- No comprehensive cleanup or error recovery functions are present.
- No evidence of valgrind-clean implementations or consistent error reporting across modules.

## Recommendations
- Implement comprehensive memory cleanup functions for all data structures.
- Add robust error handling and user-friendly error reporting throughout the codebase.
- Test with valgrind to ensure no memory leaks remain.
- Maintain norm compliance and modularity in all utility functions.
