# Phase 7: Signal Handling

## Summary
- Signal handling module exists (`src/signals/`).
- Signal logic is referenced in the shell loop and global variable is present.
- Implementation for SIGINT, SIGQUIT, and EOF is not yet complete; file is empty.

## Assessment
- Signal handling is not fully implemented; only structure and references exist.
- No code for interactive/non-interactive behavior, prompt update, or terminal state restoration.

## Recommendations
- Implement signal handler functions for SIGINT, SIGQUIT, and EOF.
- Use only one global variable for signal state as per requirements.
- Integrate signal handling with the shell loop and command execution.
- Ensure norm compliance and robust error handling in all signal logic.
