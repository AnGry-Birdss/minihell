# Phase 2: Lexical Analysis (Tokenization)

## Summary
- Lexer and tokenization modules are present (`src/lexer/`).
- Tokenizer core and quote handling files exist, but are currently empty (`tokenize.c`, `token.c`).
- Data structures for tokens are defined in headers.
- Variable expansion and quote handling are referenced in the project plan, but not yet implemented in code.

## Assessment
- Tokenization logic is not yet implemented; files are placeholders.
- No code for token type identification, quote state tracking, or variable expansion is present.
- No error handling or edge case logic for tokenization is implemented.

## Recommendations
- Implement the tokenizer core: split input into tokens, handle quotes, and identify token types.
- Add robust quote handling (single/double), including edge cases (unclosed quotes).
- Implement environment variable expansion logic, following bash behavior.
- Ensure all functions are norm-compliant (max 25 lines, 4 params, 5 vars, etc.).
- Add error handling for invalid tokens and memory management for token lists.
