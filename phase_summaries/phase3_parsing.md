# Phase 3: Parsing

## Summary
- Parser modules exist (`src/parser/`).
- Files for command, redirection, and pipeline parsing are present but currently empty.
- Data structures for commands and redirections are defined in headers.

## Assessment
- No parsing logic is implemented yet; files are placeholders.
- No code for building command structures, handling arguments, or validating syntax.
- No error handling or memory management for parsing is present.

## Recommendations
- Implement command, redirection, and pipeline parsing logic.
- Ensure parsing functions are norm-compliant and modular.
- Add error handling for invalid syntax and memory management for command structures.
- Validate pipeline and redirection syntax as per bash behavior.
