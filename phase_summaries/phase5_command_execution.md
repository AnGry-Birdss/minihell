# Phase 5: Command Execution

## Summary
- Command execution logic is implemented in `src/executor/execute.c`.
- Path resolution, process creation, and pipeline execution are present.
- Built-ins are executed in the parent or forked as needed for pipelines.

## Assessment
- Path resolution and process creation are functional for basic cases.
- Pipeline execution logic is present but may need further refinement for complex cases and built-in handling.
- Error handling and exit status collection are implemented.

## Recommendations
- Review and refine pipeline execution to ensure all commands in a pipeline are executed in their own child process with correct file descriptors.
- Ensure built-ins in pipelines are always forked and do not affect parent shell state.
- Test and handle edge cases for process creation and path resolution.
- Maintain norm compliance throughout execution logic.
