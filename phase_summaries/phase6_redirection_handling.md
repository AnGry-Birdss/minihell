# Phase 6: Redirection Handling

## Summary
- Redirection logic is implemented in `src/executor/redirections.c`.
- Handles input (`<`), output (`>`), append (`>>`), and heredoc (`<<`) redirections.
- File opening, permission checks, and fd duplication are present.

## Assessment
- Input/output redirection logic is functional for basic cases.
- Heredoc and append logic are referenced but may need further testing and edge case handling.
- Error handling and resource cleanup are present but should be reviewed for leaks and robustness.

## Recommendations
- Test and refine heredoc and append redirection logic.
- Ensure all file descriptors are closed and memory is freed after redirections.
- Add error handling for invalid files and permission errors.
- Maintain norm compliance in all redirection functions.
