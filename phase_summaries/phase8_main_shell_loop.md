# Phase 8: Main Shell Loop

## Summary
- Main shell loop is implemented in `src/main.c`.
- Reads input, processes commands, and handles exit.
- Shell initialization and cleanup functions are present.

## Assessment
- Shell loop is functional for reading input and executing commands.
- Initialization and cleanup logic are present but may need further refinement for error handling and memory management.
- Handling of empty input, EOF, and exit status is present but should be reviewed for edge cases.

## Recommendations
- Refine shell initialization and cleanup for robust error handling and memory management.
- Ensure proper handling of empty input, EOF, and shell exit.
- Maintain norm compliance and modularity in the shell loop.
- Test shell loop behavior against bash for all edge cases.
